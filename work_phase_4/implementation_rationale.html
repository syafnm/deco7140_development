                <p class="m-y-2">
                    My website is designed with international students in mind,
                    aiming to address their key needs as outlined in the user
                    stories. To ensure accurate and updated information, each
                    article includes its source and publication date, helping
                    users trust the content and stay informed with the latest
                    developments.
                </p>
                <p class="m-y-2">
                    To support interactive conversation, the website features a
                    thread-like message board where users can ask questions,
                    share insights, and engage with the community. While
                    features like commenting, liking, and sharing are not yet
                    available, they are part of the future roadmap to enhance
                    interactivity and real-time engagement.

                <p class="m-y-2">
                    Through the message board, users also gain access to real
                    student experiences, as discussions often include personal
                    stories, tips, and testimonials from fellow international
                    students. This creates a more authentic and relatable
                    environment.

                <p class="m-y-2">
                    Although the website is still a work in progress, I’ve made
                    efforts to ensure it is easy to use on mobile, allowing
                    users to navigate quickly and with minimal effort, even on
                    smaller screens. <br /><br />

                        to go directly to certain or specific article that they
                        already now. Below the search box, I put a collection of

                        English is not their mother language, I did not use any
                        scientific or difficult words. If I have to use it in
                        the article, I might put a little footnote to give a
                        context for non english speaker to make it more
                        Understandable.

                        3.2.3 Consistent Navigation<br />
                        I applied the same structure for my main webpage; Home,
                        Articles, and Communities & Networks. It begin with a
                        hero banner, title of the page, and then the content.

                        help user recognize error and handle the it. However,
                        right now, I did not implement it in my website yet.

                            inclusive, I’ve applied optional fields for certain
                            inputs, allowing users to provide only the

                <h3>Variations from A3 Design Proposal</h3>
                <p>
                    Below are the key differences and improvements I made in the
                    final design compared to my initial wireframe proposal.
                </p>

                <div class="content-card">
                    <h4>1. Homepage</h4>
                    <p>
                        Initially, I didn’t include a homepage, but I later
                        realized the importance of providing a landing page to
                        give first-time visitors clear context about the
                        website’s purpose.
                    </p>
                    <h4>2. Communities & Networks Page</h4>
                    <p>
                        I added a List Community section that wasn’t in the
                        original wireframe—this decision came from recognizing
                        the need for users to easily navigate to specific
                        community landing pages.
                    </p>
                    <h4>3. Community Landing Page</h4>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, for the Join Community feature, my initial plan
                        was to link users to third-party platforms like social
                        media. However, considering the goal of having users
                        create accounts on the website, I decided to implement a
                        built-in join form instead, allowing users to connect
                        directly through the site. I also removed the “Follow”
                        button, as it felt redundant with the new join
                        functionality.

                <h3>Challenges and Strategies</h3>
                <p> 
                    One of the main challenges I faced during this project was 
                    understanding and implementing APIs. Initially, I struggled to 
                    grasp the concept of how APIs work and how to choose the right 
                    endpoints that matched the content and functionality of my website. 
                    Making the API function correctly was also a significant hurdle. 
                    To overcome these challenges, I used Generative AI tools to deepen 
                    my understanding of APIs and their practical applications. I asked 
                    for guidance on how specific APIs could be integrated into my 
                    website and sought help in identifying suitable endpoints. 
                    Additionally, I used AI assistance to review my JavaScript and 
                    API-related code, helping me identify and fix errors more efficiently.
