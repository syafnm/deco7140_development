            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering social
                cohesion by empowering diverse communities to share their
                stories, connect with others, and access resources that enhance
                their visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and support
                the unique identities of communities across Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams at
                Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is tasked
                with developing individual concepts and prototypes for dynamic
                websites that align with CCI’s mission and vision. Our mission
                is to strengthen societal bonds by creating platforms that
                celebrate and support the unique identities of communities
                across Australia.
            </p>
            <h2 class="m-t-3">Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
                We are commissioning the development of dynamic, user-friendly
                websites that
                <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value-1"
                    >represent and support different communities.</span
                >
                Each website should serve as a central hub where community
                members can
                <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value-1"
                    >share resources, highlight events, and foster meaningful
                    connections.</span
                >
                The websites ,<span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value-1"
                    >must not include any form of commercial activity,</span
                >
                such as advertising or selling products. However, it is
                acceptable to promote resources, events, or services that are
                directly beneficial to the community. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The websites must be
                <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value-2"
                    >accessible, mobile-friendly, and reflect the diverse
                    needs</span
                >
                of the selected community focus area while adhering to our
                mission of inclusivity, accessibility, and ethical design. Each
                website should also celebrate the unique characteristics of its
                chosen community and support meaningful interaction and
                engagement.
            </p>
            
            <h2 class="m-t-3">Community Focus Areas</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1. Cultural and Heritage Communities</li>

            <h2 class="m-t-3">Additional Information</h2>
            <h3>Target Audience</h3>
            <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    1. Community Members: Individuals within the selected community
                    who seek representation, resources, and connection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. General Audience: Broader society, who can use the website
                    to learn about the community and its contributions.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless interaction
                for all users, including those relying on assistive
                technologies.
            </p>

            <h3 class="m-t-3">Project Goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    1. Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                    community, recognising and representing the diversity within
                    the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    2. Provide clear, accessible information and resources to
                    users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    3. Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                    community.
                </li>
                <li>
                    4. Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive design
                    principles are upheld.
                </li>
            </ol>
