                    <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            In completing this assignment, I used AI tools to
                            assist me with tasks such as code exploration,
                            troubleshooting errors, and exploring content ideas,
                            help me make some components. I also used them to help
                            paraphrase sentences used on this website.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Critical Decision-Making and Ownership</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            When asking the AI tools to help me with the code, I provide 
                            descriptions to make the code more specific to my needs. 
                            I also copy only the code that I need, and modify it using my own components
                            that I already made. Sometimes, I asked the AI tools the specific 
                            way or specific code that I wanted. For example, I asked for how to
                            make a bold sentences in a paragraph, eventhough in the end I did not use it 
                            because of some considerations.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To explore the content, I looked at the example in the module provided
                            then I asked AI to make the similar things. I copy the example's structured
                            then try to equalize it with my knowledge. With Copilot's help, I
                            paraphrased the text content to improve my grammar.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Accuracy, Bias, and Ethical Awareness</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            I am aware that the code provided by AI tools is not always
                            accurate, so I always check and evaluate the code before
                            deciding to use it. I also make sure that the code is
                            accessible and ethical. For the content, I make sure that
                            the content is aligned with my own understanding of ethical
                            design and accessibility. I also make sure that the content
                            is not biased and does not contain any sensitive information.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Privacy and Sensitive Contents</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            I did not use any sensitive information when using AI tools.
                            I only used general information that is available to the
                            public. I also made sure that the content is respectful and
                            does not contain any offensive language.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Reflective on Learning</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Using AI tools has helped me to explore and ideate
                            more efficiently. It has also helped me to improve my
                            grammar and writing skills. However, I am aware that
                            I should not rely too much on AI tools and should
                            always evaluate the content and code provided by them.
                            I also learned to be more critical and ethical when
                            using AI tools. For example, when I want to produce code
                            I make sure that I only use code that I understand and
                            can modify.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Attribution and Final Statement</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            AI tools helped with some stages of my approach,
                            such as exploring, ideating, and paraphrasing. I
                            made all of the decisions on content, language, and
                            alignment with user needs. The final submission is a
                            reflection of my own study, principles, and
                            comprehension of ethical, accessible design.
                        </p>
