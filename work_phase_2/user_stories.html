                            from other international students also help. If the website regularly 
                            updates events, tips, and local services, I’d keep coming back as my

                        Act as Budi, a 19 year old international student from Indonesia who 
                        just arrived in Australia by himself. This is the first time he is 
                        away from home. He is looking for informations about international 
                        communities and events, any events for bachelor students, any facts 
                        and tips living in Australia. Mostly, he uses phone to look for information.

                    <p class="question">
                        1. What kind of information do you need most when you
                        first arrive in Australia? How you gain information
                        about that?

                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        <p>
                            When I first arrived in Australia, the information I needed most was about living 
                            and studying here, like how to open a bank account, get a SIM card, access healthcare, 
                            and find affordable groceries. I also wanted to know about international student 
                            communities and events or activities where I could meet new people. I usually find 
                            this information through university websites and student portals, social media or 
                            messaging groups for international students, apps like Meetup or Eventbrite for events, 
                            and by asking other students or friends who have experience living here.

                    <p class="question">
                        2. How do you usually find out about and join events for
                        international students?

                    <div class="response p-x-3">
                        <p>
                            I usually find out about and join events for international students by checking 
                            university websites and student portals, which often list orientation sessions, 
                            workshops, or social events. I also follow social media and messaging groups, 
                            like Facebook or WhatsApp groups for international students, where people share 
                            events. Apps like Meetup or Eventbrite are helpful to discover nearby events. 
                            Sometimes I see flyers or posters on campus with QR codes to register. After 
                            finding an event, I either register online or just attend if it’s free and open.

                        <p>
                            As an international student in Australia, I usually make friends by joining university 
                            clubs, events, and orientation activities, which helps me meet people with similar interests. 
                            I also connect with classmates through study groups and classes, which naturally builds 
                            friendships. Social media and messaging apps, like Facebook, WhatsApp, or Discord groups 
                            for students, are useful for meeting people before and after arriving. Sometimes I meet new 
                            friends through meetups, part-time jobs, or volunteering. I usually start by introducing myself 
                            and joining shared activities, then follow up online or hang out outside class.

                            Yes, I’m interested in both sharing my experiences and reading stories from other 
                            community members. I find it helpful to read short posts or articles with tips and 
                            personal experiences because I can quickly scroll through them on my phone.

                            are also useful because I can ask questions directly and get real-time advice. 
                            Sometimes, short videos are good too, especially if they show practical tips, like 
                            navigating campus or cooking simple meals, because it’s easier to understand than 
                            just reading.

                            The biggest challenges I face using a community website on my phone are slow 
                            loading times and complicated layouts that are hard to navigate on a small screen. 
                            Some websites have menus or buttons that don’t fit well on mobile, making it difficult 
                            to find information quickly. Too much text or cluttered pages can also be overwhelming. 
                            Sometimes, important features like event registration or messaging don’t work well on 
                            mobile, which makes the experience frustrating.
