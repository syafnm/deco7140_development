                <p>
                    Reflective design focuses on creating products that encourage users to think 
                    about their actions and the implications of their choices. This approach aims 
                    to foster a deeper connection between users and the product, promoting mindfulness 
                    and intentionality in their interactions.
                </p>

                <h4 class="m-y-3">Checklist for Reflective Design</h4>
                <ul class="checklist m-y-2">
                    <li>- Refer to level of study instead of age </li>
                    <li>- Use gender-neutral language for user’s pronoun </li>
                    <li>- Use respectful language </li>
                    <li>- Use Person-first language when you don’t understand individual or community preferences. </li>
