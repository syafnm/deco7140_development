                        Act as Aisha, a 24 year old international student from
                        Indonesia who just arrived in Australia for 1 month. She
                        is looking for informations about international student
                        communities and events, local services support, any
                        facts and tips living in Australia for international
                        students. Mostly, she uses phone to look for

                        first arrive in Australia? How you gain information
                        about that?

                        <p>
                            I needed info about accommodation, transport, mobile
                            SIM, banking, and university services. I got it from
                            university orientation, official websites,
                            Facebook/WhatsApp groups, and Google searches on my
                            phone.

                            and international offices. I also use Facebook
                            groups, WhatsApp, Meetup, and Eventbrite to find
                            events.
