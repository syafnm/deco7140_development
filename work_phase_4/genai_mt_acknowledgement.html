                    <h3>Context and Purpose</h3>
                    <p>
                        During the website implementation process, I used
                        Generative AI tools such as M365 Copilot and Claude AI
                        to assist with design, coding, and content development.
                        These tools supported various tasks, including
                        navigation bar styling, responsive layout creation,
                        JavaScript integration, and content structuring.
                    </p>
                </section>

                <section class="content-section">
                    <h3>
                        How These Tools Supported Creativity, Technical
                        Proficiency, and Problem-Solving
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Copilot helped me design and style navigation bars and
                        layouts, providing initial ideas that aligned with my
                        wireframes. It also assisted in writing semantic
                        HTML/CSS and linking JavaScript files correctly,
                        improving my understanding of module scripts and fetch
                        API usage. Lastly, Claude AI generated a complete
                        HTML/CSS structure for the Community Landing page, which
                        solved time constraints and gave me a solid starting
                        point for API integration.

                            Some outputs lacked responsiveness or accessibility
                            features. Solution: I refined prompts and manually
                            adjusted the code to meet best practices.

                            AI suggestions sometimes conflicted with my

                            against my original design and project requirements.

                    <h3>Strategies for Critical Evaluation and Refinement</h3>
                    <p>
                        To ensure the reliability and quality of AI-generated
                        outputs, I applied several critical evaluation
                        strategies. First, I tested all generated code in the
                        browser to confirm functionality and responsiveness. I
                        also validated the HTML and CSS using accessibility
                        tools such as the IBM Equal Access Checker to ensure
                        compliance with accessibility standards. Additionally, I
                        refined the code manually to improve semantic
                        correctness and maintain consistency with my original
                        design requirements. These steps helped me maintain
                        control over the final implementation while leveraging
                        AI for efficiency.

                    <h3>Productivity Improvements and Effective Use Cases</h3>
                    <p>
                        Using GenAI tools made my work faster and more
                        efficient. For example, Copilot helped me quickly design
                        and style the navigation bar and create responsive
                        layouts without starting from scratch. It also saved
                        time by generating CSS for forms and suggesting
                        improvements for layout and styling. When I needed to
                        paraphrase content for the Implementation Rationale
                        page, Copilot provided clear drafts that I could refine.
                        These tools were especially useful for repetitive tasks
                        and adjusting styles.

                    <h3>Insights for Future Use in Professional Practice</h3>
                    <p>
                        From this experience, I learned that GenAI tools are
                        helpful but need to be used carefully. In the future, I
                        will make sure to check all outputs for accuracy and
                        accessibility before using them. I also realized the
                        importance of being transparent about AI-assisted work
                        so that users and stakeholders know what was generated
                        by AI. Ethical use is important because AI can sometimes
                        produce biased or incorrect results. These tools should
                        support my work, not replace my own judgment and
                        creativity.
